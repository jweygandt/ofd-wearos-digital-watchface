A HACK at a first cut for a digital watch face...

NOTE - this is still a HACK and WORK IN PROGRESS, but you are welcome to look at,
copy, and perhaps suggest changes. I do use the watch face daily.

My goal is to get more complications onto the watch.

Also I noticed that images, called monochromatic... are really in full color, and that
color could be supported. So why not.

I do wish Samsung did better with the complications they deliver, when used with
3rd party watch faces, but they don't! So I'm also doing some complications myself.
You can look at HonestHeartRate and MoonPhase.

Complications:
1-4 Are short text and icon. If you attach the battery level complication, I do some
custom drawing of the icon.

5 - is the large long text calendar. Seems Samsung does thier calendar in thier watches
differently, we only get one event. Still working on this.

6-9 Are icon only, inteded as shortcuts for apps or contacts

10-11 are Range Icons. I've modified an Air Quality Complication to do some special
rendering, will post that later.

12 is a full size background intended for the Moon Phase (sorry you need to get your
own moon photos)

As to editing - man that seems more complex than it should. For a while I was using
the phone app, and it worked, then suddenly most of the complications disappeared,
even for Samsung's watchfaces! So I have a 4x3 grid of buttons. It's functional

So still lots to do, but I'm making it public as there are so few wear os
open source projects so far.
